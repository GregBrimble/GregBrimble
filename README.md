# Greg Brimble

After a successful internship last summer, I will be returning to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) next year as a full-time Software Engineer in Emerging Technologies and Incubation.

Presently, I am a final year student at the University of Edinburgh, studying [Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/utaisen.htm), and previously, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering. I have been a recipient of [The IET Great Exhibition Scholarship](https://conferences.theiet.org/achievement/scholarships/diamond/1851.cfm), as well as the James Clayton Undergraduate Scholarship from the Institute of Mechanical Engineers.

Before Cloudflare, I worked as a Research & Development Software Engineer at [Administrate](https://www.getadministrate.com/about/our-team/)—a cloud-based SaaS company, based in Edinburgh.

I have a massive passion for technology, programming, engineering, and artificial intelligence; and I have previously volunteered as a Technological Engineer at the [International Children’s Advisory Network (iCAN Research)](https://www.icanresearch.com/), a charity focused on advocating for research and innovation in pediatric clinical healthcare.
